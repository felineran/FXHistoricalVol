########## It's good practice to keep example usage separate to your source code files.

#ma = drawupanddown(filename="EURUSD_D1_Bid.csv",lookbackperiod="365D",NofSimulation=1000)

#draw histogram of max drawup and drawdown

########## This makes two charts within the same graphical device. 
#par(mfrow=c(2,1))

########## The hist() function returns an object of class "histogram". The data
########## within will be necessary to add anything to this chart. I've assigned
########## the results to variable histdata. I've also added the parameter 
########## xlab="Drawdowns" for more professional appearance. 

#histdata = hist(ma[,1], main="Histogram of Max Drawdown", xlab="Drawdowns")

########## For cosmetic reasons I've changed this to a dashed red line such that
########## it's easier to spot immediately. Blue does not stand out as much, and
########## it's worth noting that dashed lines will be much easier to see on 
########## paper printed in black and white. 

#abline(v = ma[1,1], col="red", lty=2)

########## In your original code you used a fairly arbitrary '150' as the y 
########## value. If you work through a number of different NofSimulations you'll
########## see that this hard-coded value will mean the function won't work properly.
########## I've thus changed the '150' to mean(histdata$counts), which will ensure
########## the text displays regardless of NofSimulations. 

#text(ma[1,1], mean(histdata$counts), "Obs Drawdown", col = "red")


#histdatarunup = hist(ma[,2], main="Histogram of Max Runup", xlab="Runups")
